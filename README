This repository contains example MATLAB code to analyze the dataset 'Automatic
and non-automatic finger and leg movements measured with functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS)' (https://doi.org/10.34973/vesb-mh30).
It follows the analysis as provided in the paper 'fNIRS is sensitive to leg
activity in the primary motor cortex after systemic artifact correction'
(NeuroImage, 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.119880).
It requires installation of the Homer3 toolbox (https://openfnirs.org/software/homer/homer3/)
and the FieldTrip toolbox (https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/).

DISCLAIMER: the original nirs analysis from the NeuroImage paper was performed
with the GUI from Homer3 and started from the original .oxy4-files. The scripts
provided here start from the bids_raw data and are analyzed with a script based
on Homer functions. Therefore, the exact values of the results might deviate a
little from the original paper.

CONTENT:
========
NIRS_ANALYSIS
Loads the nirs data, preprocesses the data and performs a GLM analysis.
The data is saved for later statistical analysis (nirs_statistics.m) or
visualization (nirs_plot.m).
Input:
- *.snirf files (bids_raw: nirs)
- *events.tsv files (bids_raw: nirs)
Output:
- gamma.mat: output of the GLM analysis with gamma function for each participant (for statistics)
- gaussian.mat: output of the GLM analysis with gaussians for each participant (for visualization)
Dependencies:
- Homer3 toolbox
- custom_Homerfunct: see separate folder

NIRS_STATISTICS
performs the t-test statistics based on the GLM output with gamma
functions.
Input:
- gamma.mat (created by nirs_analysis.m)
Output:
- stat_*.tsv: output table with the statistics for each condition and each chromophore
- N_by_channel.mat: overview of the number of participants for each channel

NIRS_PLOT
Plots the outcome of the GLM analysis with gaussians. Plots each channel
separately with HbO in red and HbR in blue and a shaded area containing
the 95% confidence intervals.
Input:
- gaussian.mat (created by nirs_analysis.m)
- N_by_channel.mat  (created by nirs_statistics.m)
Dependencies:
- Fieldtrip toolbox
- (Homer3 toolbox)

CUSTOM_HOMERFCT
Folder containing customized Homer3 functions. See description of functions for
more explanation.
